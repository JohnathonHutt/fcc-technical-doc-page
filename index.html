          <h2>About Ruby</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.</p>

        <p>He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.</p>

        <p>Building on this, he adds:</p>

        <br>

        <p><i>"Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body."</i></p>

          <h2>Fun Facts</h2>

        <p>What makes Ruby unique?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Ruby was invented in Japan.</li>
          <li>But it reads like plain English.</li>
          <li>Syntax is intuitive and descriptive</li>
          <li>Everything is an object</li>
          <li>Ruby is an open source language.</li>
          <li>Cartoon foxes - look into it...</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">

        <header>
          <h2>Hello World</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Text or strings are displayed in Ruby by using puts (for put string), which prints the string and adds a newline to the end of the string.</p>

        <code>puts "Hello World"</code>

        <p>Alternatively, the print command can be used. The difference between these two commands is that print does not add a newline to the end of the statement.</p>

        <code>print "hello World"</code>

      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Syntax">

        <header>
          <h2>Syntax</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Ruby is known for it's elegant syntax - take one line if statements for example.</p>

        <code>puts "Get some coffee" if alertness == 0</code>

        <p>Here is an example of a Ruby method. Notice the absence of curly braces and semicolons.</p>

        <code>def say_hello(name)<br>    return "Hello, " + name<br>end</code>

        <p>One of the many cool Ruby features are implicit return statements.
        In Ruby methods return the last statement that is evaluated, meaning that the previous method can be simpified to... </p>

        <code>def say_hello(name)<br>     "Hello, " + name<br>end</code>

        <p>As my first programming language Ruby holds a special place in my heart. This page, however, is really just an exercise in formatting a technical documentation page using HTML and CSS - as a result I didn't want to spend any appreciable amount of time creating and or curating the content.
          Ruby is a cool language though and if you find yourself reading this and would like to know more I've included a list of the resources I used to learn Ruby. Enjoy.</p>
